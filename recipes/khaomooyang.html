    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Thai grilled pork neck is a type of grilled meat most commonly associated with the Isan or Northeastern Thai cuisine. We call it "kor moo yang" in Thai, which translates to "pork neck grilled."</p>
    <p>This dish extremely delicious, filling, and satisfying. Pork neck is an amazing cut of meat in itself because it has both lean meat and the juicy fat, which give you a really well-balanced flavor and texture. It's oh-so-dreamy when you grill it until smoky on the outside but still soft on the inside. The smell, the taste...everything about it is just so good. You can literally tell you're about to walk past a grilled pork neck stand when you're still a few meters away. For those of you who really want to make this easy dish at home, if you can't find pork neck or jowl where you live, you can use pork shoulder or even pork belly instead. The results will still be pretty much the same.</p>
